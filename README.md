# Anti-C-bug-FilterScript
Anti C-bug script made by Lil$Moon.
This is a very powerful Anti c bug script, cannot be bypassed.
even if you aim and press c the anti c bug will stop you.
You can use the file as a filterscript and it will run when you open the server.
Copy all those lines and paste them in OnPlayerKeyStateChange. and copy the functions somewhere else.
